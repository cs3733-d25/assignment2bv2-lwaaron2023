A note to the grader:

Since for the hobby, list, table, and form tags I created a more modular tag for each that allowed information to be passed in as an array and for it to be formatted by other 
variables in the corresponding types, I believe that two seperate hobby, list, etc files are not needed as the differences in presentation of the elements is already allowed by the corresponding files.

This is because my hobby tag is intended to allow the programmer to choose the order, quantity, and contents of the sub-elemnets generated by the hobby tag. This is shown through the ordering field in hobby as well as the arrays for the types of permitted elements in a hobby. Please refer to the documentation in each file for more details about how each tag is supposed to be generated.

Therefore, adding a seperate tag with seperate order and quantity of elements would be redudant to the design of the corresponding files.
